**Commit**

**Branch**

**Merge**
a git command that combines 2 branches into 1 branch

---
# Git CLI (Command Line Interface)

`git init` create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

`git status` see status of this repository

`git log` show commit logs

`git add` add file contents to the index

`git commit` record changes to the repository

`git branch` list, create, or delete branches

`git merge` join two or more development histories together

`git reset` reset current HEAD to the specified state

(üòÖ that's a lot to remember. we can just use VSCode for now üòé)

# Initialize a local git repository (CLI)

In order to track changes in your `notes/` directory

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your `notes/` directory

2. Type in `git init` to setup a new git repository

    This command creates a `.git/` folder to track changes


---

# Make a commit (CLI)

1. Use `git add` to stage files you want to commit

    `git add .` If you want to add everything

2. `git commit -m "Initial commit"`

---
# Initialize a local git repository (VSCode)

This creates a `.git/` folder to track changes

![](./vscode-git-init.png)

---

# Commit Message

Commit messages help a future reader quickly understand what changed and why it changed

Please read this post on [Best Practices](https://initialcommit.com/blog/git-commit-messages-best-practices)

___

# Commit Message Examples

## Bad

`debugging`
`I added a delete route to the accounts controller`
`chanages`

## Good

`Enable logging globally`
`Add account delete route`


___

# Git GUI Tools
I **highly** recommend using a git GUI tool

VSCode source control with [GitLens](https://open-vsx.org/extension/eamodio/gitlens)

[Sourcetree](https://sourcetreeapp.com)

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
