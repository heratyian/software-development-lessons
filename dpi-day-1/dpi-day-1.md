# Welcome üòÅ
* Thank you embarking on this journey with us.
* Please find and open the link to this slide deck in Canvas
* Throughout the quarter, I'll be using a service called PollEverywhere to embed polls and activities in the slides.
<!-- TODO: add  -->
* Please visit this URL now: https://pollev.com/
* If you already have an account, sign in. Otherwise it may ask you to sign up, or it may just ask you for a name. Please use something that matches your name in Canvas so we can give you credit. By "Credit", we just mean participation; there are no wrong answers for the PollEv exercises.
* You should see a survey about your prior programming experience (you might need to refresh the page). Please fill out the survey. (We may run into the response limit for this first poll; don't worry, if so. You'll be able to participate in the later polls.)

# Let's get to know each other!
* During class, we'll have lots of group exercises and breakout rooms; and I hope you'll form study groups to work on homeworks together.
* Please form groups of 3-4 with people sitting around you, and share:
* Your name.
* Where you're from, and which neighborhood you live in now.
* Why did you sign up for this course?
* What's one thing you like to geek out about? (It could be a hobby, a place, a tv show, a food; anything.)
* Compare schedules/locations for potential study buddies.
