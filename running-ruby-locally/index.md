# Running Ruby On Your Own Machine

---
# TODO

1. Play around with `irb`

2. Create `Workspace/scratch` folder

3. Setup and configure your code editor (vscode)

4. Write and run a ruby program on your machine

---

# Terminal
open your terminal
<!-- command + space (open spotlight search) -->
<!-- search 'terminal', press `enter` -->

# Ruby
Ruby comes preinstalled on macOS

`ruby --version` or `ruby -v` to check version

This is your system ruby. You'll need to install different versions when developing rails applications. We'll get into this later.

Make sure you are using the correct version in [Ruby Docs](https://ruby-doc.org/)
