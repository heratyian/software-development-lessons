# Taking Notes And Writing Like A Developer
Many ways to keep notes and write about code. This is how I do it.

---

# TODO
* create a `Workspace/notes` directory for daily notes
* create a markdown file `*.md` for todays notes
  * TIL
  * TODOs
  * links
  * meeting notes
  * timesheet / schedule

---

# Why?
* need a place to track your learning, links, meeting notes, schedule, todos, etc.
* README and technical documentation are often written in markdown
* piazza, slack, github, stack overflow and many other websites support markdown

---

# Notes Folder
* create a `notes` directory in your `Workspace` for daily notes
* `cd Workspace` navigate to Workspace directory
* `mkdir notes` create a notes directory
* `code notes` open notes directory in vscode
* `touch 2023-02-10_notes.md`
