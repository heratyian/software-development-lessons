# Working together on GitHub (branching, merging, and pull requests)
  
We'll be working together on this [repository](https://github.com/DPI-class/link-in-bio)

Please follow the README.

## Add your link
- Create a branch off of `main` named something like `add-ian-link`.
- Add your link in bio link to the readme using markdown link syntax.
- Make a commit.
- Push your branch (publish your branch).
- Make a pull request in the repository.
- Tag at least 2 of your classmates to review your work.
- When you have at least 2 approvals, merge your pull request. üéâ
- If you encounter a merge conflict, you'll need to enter `git pull origin main` to pull the latest changes and resolve the conflict. Make sure to not delete other peoples' work.

## Review pull requests
- Make sure to pull a copy of the branch and run it on your machine to verify it's working as expected.
- If you see something is not right, make a comment on the pull request to request a change.
- When all your comments have been resolved, or it's looking good, approve the pull request. üëç
