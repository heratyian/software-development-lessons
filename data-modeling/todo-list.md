# Let's figure out the data model behind this [Todo List app](https://ujs-practice-1.matchthetarget.com/)

- Sign up for an account, click around the app, and acquaint yourself with it.
- You can also sign in with the existing user "alice@example.com", password "password".
- Imagine that it's a mockup, and that you've been hired to build an app like that. (Don't come up with additional features or improvements; our job is to build it as it is now.)
- What tables and columns will you need? Try to produce a complete list of tables and columns.
- I find it helpful to use paper or a spreadsheet to actually draw out all my tables, columns, and try entering in rows to make sure I can record everything necessary for all screens and possible user actions that I can see in the mockup.
