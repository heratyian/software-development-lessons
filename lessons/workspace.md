## Workspace
- As a developer, organizing your files and folders effectively can greatly enhance your productivity.
- While the specific folder structure may vary depending on your personal preferences and the technologies you work with, here are some standard folders that many developers find useful on their machines:

### 'workspace'
- This folder serves as the main directory for your development projects.
- You can create subfolders for each project, keeping the project files and resources organized.
- It's typically located at the user root `~`

1. Open terminal
2. Enter `open .` to open finder at user root
3. Create `Workspace` folder
4. Drag Workspace to Finder Favorites for Easy Access (macOS)
5. Open `Workspace` folder

### 'notes'
- This folder is for your personal notes, ideas, and documentation unrelated to any specific project.
- It can be a place to jot down code snippets, learning resources, or any other information that you find useful in your development journey.
- [I write notes in markdown](./taking-notes) and create a new file for each day.

1. Create `notes` folder inside `Workspace`

### 'scratch' 
- This folder is for experimentation and quick code prototyping.
- It can be a space to create small projects, test ideas, or try out new technologies without cluttering your main projects.

1. Create `scratch` folder inside `Workspace`
