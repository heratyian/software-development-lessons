## Taking Notes And Writing Like A Developer
- Many ways to keep notes and write about code. This is how I do it.
- Create a `Workspace/notes` directory for daily notes
- Open `notes/` folder in [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Create a markdown file `*.md` for todays notes
    - TIL
    - TODOs
    - links
    - meeting notes
    - timesheet / schedule
    - etc.

## Why?
- Need a place to track your learning, links, meeting notes, schedule, todos, etc.
- README and technical documentation are often written in markdown
- Piazza, Slack, GitHub, StackOverflow and many other websites support markdown

## [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- Any file ending in `*.md` or `*.markdown`
- VSCode automagically supports markdown
    - `command + shift + v` to view markdown preview in VSCode
