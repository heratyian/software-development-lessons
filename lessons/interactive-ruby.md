### Scenario
- You're working on a coding problem 🧑‍💻.
- You need to test and experiment with small snippets of Ruby code quickly and interactively test an idea.
- Luckily, you have the IRB shell 🪄✨.
- In the IRB shell, you can try out lines of Ruby code and see the results immediately, without the need for writing and running a whole program.
- It's like having a virtual playground where you can experiment and explore the capabilities of Ruby in real-time ⚙️🔬.
- With each session in the IRB shell, your skills grow stronger, and you'll become more confident in your ability to write robust and efficient Ruby code 💪💎.


### Shell
1. open a terminal
    - locally (Ruby comes preinstalled on macOS)
    - [replit](https://replit.com/)
    - [codespace](https://github.com/appdev-projects/base-rails)
2. In a terminal you can enter `ruby --version` or `ruby -v` to check version
3. Make sure you are using the correct version in [Ruby Docs](https://ruby-doc.org/) 
4. type `irb` and hit enter
5. You are now in the `irb` shell
6. Play around with ruby.
    - Create a variable. `name = "ian"`
    - Print to I/O. `puts name`
    - etc.
7. Type `exit` and hit enter to exit irb shell

- Yay! 🎉 You've done your first irb session
