# Yet Another Ruby

## [Part 1: Nouns, Verbs, & Grammar](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/754)
Now that we've learned how to format documents and link them together with HTML, it's time to dive into Ruby so that we can automate the process of writing the HTML pages and populating their content dynamically when users visit URLs!

To get our feet wet with Ruby, read the following chapters on chapters.firstdraft.com. Make sure to try out the Ruby you read about in the embedded programming environments, called "REPLs". Experiment!

## [Part 13: Glance over The One Ruby Reference](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/774)

Check out The One Ruby Reference. This is a single Chapter that has brief descriptions of the most important Ruby class and methods that we'll encounter this quarter. It's intended to be easier to scan through for a method than having to click through each class's chapter; but, keep in mind that it has stuff in there that we haven't encountered yet.

Try opening the Table of Contents by clicking the firstdraft logo in the top-left corner and scanning the list of classes and methods that way.
