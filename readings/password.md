# Setup a Password Manager

I've noticed a lot of apprentices still use pen/paper or a text file on their computer to store passwords.

Please sign up for a password manager and enter the url of the one you've chosen. I personally use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). (which is free for personal use and syncs desktop/mobile). There are many out there. Do your research.
