# Another get-to-know-each-other

Please get into groups of 3-4 (ideally, with people you haven't done one of these with before) and share one of the following:
* What’s the last thing you bought yourself?
* What would your best friend say about who you are and what makes you tick?
* What is something adventurous that you’ve done?
* Is there something that you’ve dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven’t you done it?
* Who or what do you turn to when you need to recharge?

---

# What are the associations?
* Cities and Neighborhoods
* Courses and Students
* Photographers and Photos
* Bands and Venues
* Contractors and Clients
* States and Senators
* Groups and Members

---

# One-to-Many or Many-to-Many?
When you're deciding, ask yourself:
* Can one x have many y?
* Can one y have many x?

The answer is usually: it depends on what you're building. Justify it.

### If **One-to-Many**, which table gets the **foreign key** column?
### If **Many-to-Many**, what’s a good name for the **join table**?
