# [Optional] More Ruby basics at Codecademy

This assignment is optional, but if you're feeling shaky on Ruby fundamentals, it is recommended even if you're behind schedule.

If you finish with Courses 1 through 6 of Treehouse's Learn Ruby Track and feel like you want more practice with the fundamentals of Ruby, then you can also optionally do Parts 1â€”6 of  [Codecademy's Learn Ruby Track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby). Codecademy is free with a premium tier for additional exercises; the free tier should be enough to start with.

We're going to have another introduction to Ruby after this, so don't worry if some concepts are still fuzzy.
