# Final Project Ideas, Round 1

Have you noticed any pain points that you think we might be able to solve with a web application?

Jot down what you're thinking here, so that we can start to scope/filter the ideas and select a good one to start with.

We will repeat this process a few times before final selection, so don't worry too much about what you write down in this round. Just get any and all ideas out of your head and down on "paper".
