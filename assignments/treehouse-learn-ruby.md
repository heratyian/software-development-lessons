# Overview of Treehouse's Learn Ruby Track

To get our first taste of Ruby, we're going to go through most of [Treehouse's Learn Ruby Track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-ruby). The Track contains 11 courses, of which 4 are required:

Ruby Basics
Ruby Collections
Ruby Loops
Ruby Objects and Classes
Your main job while going through Treehouse is to think of questions to ask! That's when the learning happens.

We're going to have at least one more introduction to Ruby after this, so don't worry if some concepts are still fuzzy.
